    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the perfect recipe if you have a lot of zucchini to use up. It is important to thinly slice the zucchini, so I use the slicer on my box grater. I sometimes fill 4 baking sheets at a time. You can eat it warm or cold. I will eat this portion all by myself.</p>

        <li>combine thinly sliced zucchini and olive oil in a bowl</li>
        <li>spread the sliced zucchini in a single layer on the baking sheets</li>
        <li>roast in the preheated onen until the zucchini are soft and lightly brown on the edges or for about 20 to 25 minutes</li>
